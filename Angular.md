# Features Of Angular

## Template Engine

## Data Binding

## Forms

## Routing

## Observables

## PWA - Download as a native app for mob/desktop

## tsconfig.json
- change the "strict": true mode in tsconfig.json
- noImplicitAny in tsconfig.json
- sourceMap to debug code
- noEmit for not to generate js file
-  "outDir": "./dist" to see the generated output

# TypeScript v4 (Microsoft) -> (Google)
- Strongly typed programming language
- Superset of JavaScript
- Compiles to JavaScript
- TypeScript comes with its own compiler called TSC.

## Type Safety


## Installing and creating first typeScript program
- Install node - 20.9.0(current)
- Create Folder
- in terminal -> npm init
- Should see package.json in folder
- in terminal -> npm i typscript
- in terminal -> Use this ``tsc --init`` or this ``npx tsc --init``
- Create a dataTypes.ts file for practice.
- in terminal -> ``tsc`` or ``npx tsc``  ->  creates dataTypes.js file.
- After writing code in .ts file, in terminal type -> npx tsc -> node dataTypes

## SPA (Single page application)
- SPA does not make requests to server for every URL requests. Like AJAX

## Angular Helps
- Angular has routing functionality.
- SSR(Server side rendering) good for SEO(Search engine optimization) which supports SPA.

## Agenda
### DATA types
- string
- number
- boolean
- array
- enum
- tuple
- any
- void
- never

### Different ways to write functions
- Name function
- Function expression
- Arrow function

### Generic function

### Optional Parameters 

### Required Parameters

### Rest Parameters

### Type Inference
Type script has the ability to determine the type of data type assigned. Like ``let name = "Sarath"``, ts finds this is a string.

### Union and intersection Types

### Generics

### Literal types

### Decorators are annotations in angular
- Can modify the behavior of class, method at run time.
- Used internally by angular.


# Angular

## install Angular

### To crreate empty and add projects
- To install angular cli - `npm i @angular/cli -g`
- To check the version - `ng --version` or `ng version`
```
If face any issue to check the version, then try this.

Run the bellow commands in shell.
1. Get-ExecutionPolicy - If the policy is set to "Restricted" or "AllSigned," you need to change it to allow script execution. 
2. Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser - this will change the mode
3. * To revert back use this command - Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser

```
- To create new work space empty - `ng new angularProj --createApplicationfalse`
- Install npm  - `npm i`
- install packages - `ng g app hotelInventory`

### To create work space with default project
-- `ng new hoteInventory`
